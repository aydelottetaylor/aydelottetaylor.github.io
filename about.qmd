## Background

Hi, I’m Taylor! I’m a Computer Science student at Brigham Young University on the Data Science and Machine Learning track. I’ve always been fascinated by the patterns hidden in data and the way analytics can be used to solve complex problems. My journey started with a love for sports analytics—especially basketball—but has grown into exploring broader applications like finance, healthcare, and time series forecasting.

Beyond sports data, I’ve applied my skills to projects ranging from predicting sales data for businesses to experimenting with AI in games like Othello. I’m also exploring opportunities in research, including cancer data analysis with Huntsman Cancer Institute and data quality work with FamilySearch. These experiences have taught me how versatile data science is and how it can make a real impact.

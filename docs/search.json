I’ve always been fascinated by the patterns hidden in data and the way analytics can be used to solve complex problems. My journey started with a love for sports analytics—especially basketball—but has grown into exploring broader applications like finance, healthcare, and time series forecasting.\nBeyond sports data, I’ve applied my skills to projects ranging from predicting sales data for businesses to experimenting with AI in games like Othello. I’m also exploring opportunities in research, including cancer data analysis with Huntsman Cancer Institute and data quality work with FamilySearch. These experiences have taught me how versatile data science is and how it can make a real impact."

    "title": "BYU Basketball: Offensive Firepower Meets Defensive Potential",
    "section": "The Defensive Question",
    "text": "The Defensive Question\nBYU’s offense carried the spotlight last season, but their defense sometimes lagged behind. Statistically, the Cougars hovered in the low 50s to 60s nationally in both defensive rating and SRS, putting them closer to “good enough” than “elite.”\nWhen the competition stiffened, that gap became clear. Against Alabama in the Sweet 16, BYU gave up 113 points—a performance that highlighted just how much defensive shortcomings can undo even a strong offensive showing.\nSt. John’s provided a mirror image, leaning on an excellent defense but struggling offensively, finishing around 60th in offensive rating. In their tournament matchup, they were held to only 66 points against Arkansas. Both examples show the same lesson: balance is the difference between being good and being great.\nEfficiencies among 2025 Final Four teams:\n\nDuke: #1 Off. Rating, #4 Def. Rating\nHouston: #10 Off. Rating, #1 Def. Rating\nFlorida: #3 Off. Rating, #9 Def. Rating\nAuburn: #2 Off. Rating, #7 Def. Rating\n\nThe lesson? True contenders must balance both ends of the floor."

    "text": "Defensive Potential This Season (2025-26)\nHere’s where optimism kicks in. Richie Saunders praised teammates like Kennard Davis (Southern Illinois transfer) for their defensive hustle and intensity. Other defensive contrubutors will include Richie Saunders himself, Keba Keita in the middle, and AJ Dybantsa—the nation’s top high school recruit and the projected #1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. Dybantsa brings elite talent and a reputation for relentless effort on both ends of the floor, making him a potential game-changer from day one.\nIn short, BYU finds themselves with a roster that is:\n\nLoaded with athleticism.\n\nFull of guys who take pride in defense.\n\nCommitted to building an identity beyond scoring.\n\nIf BYU can maintain offensive efficiency and elevate their defensive metrics, they’ll move into the conversation as a true national title threat."

Consistency vs top teams – will defensive effort translate against elite competition?\n3. Sustaining offense – can BYU repeat or improve upon last year’s incredible efficiency?\nIf the answer is “yes” to all three, this could be one of the most exciting BYU seasons in years."

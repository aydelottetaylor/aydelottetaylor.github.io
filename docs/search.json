    "text": "The Defensive Question\nBYU’s offense carried the spotlight last season, but their defense sometimes lagged behind. Statistically, the Cougars hovered in the low 50s to 60s nationally in both defensive rating and SRS, putting them closer to “good enough” than “elite.”\nWhen the competition stiffened, that gap became clear. Against Alabama in the Sweet 16, BYU gave up 113 points—a performance that highlighted just how much defensive shortcomings can undo even a strong offensive showing.\nSt. John’s provided a mirror image, leaning on an excellent defense but struggling offensively, finishing around 60th in offensive rating. In their tournament matchup, they were held to only 66 points against Arkansas. Both examples show the same lesson: balance is the difference between being good and being great.\nEfficiencies among 2025 Final Four teams:\n\nDuke: #1 Off. Rating, #4 Def. Rating\nHouston: #10 Off. Rating, #1 Def. Rating\nFlorida: #3 Off. Rating, #9 Def. Rating\nAuburn: #2 Off. Rating, #7 Def. Rating\n\nThe lesson? True contenders must balance both ends of the floor."

Dybantsa brings elite talent and a reputation for relentless effort on both ends of the floor, making him a potential game-changer from day one.\nIn short, BYU finds themselves with a roster that is:\n\nLoaded with athleticism.\n\nFull of guys who take pride in defense.\n\nCommitted to building an identity beyond scoring.\n\nIf BYU can maintain offensive efficiency and elevate their defensive metrics, they’ll move into the conversation as a true national title threat."

    "section": "Designing the Contender Score",
    "text": "Designing the Contender Score\nOne of the first things that I needed to think about when trying to figure out what makes a title contender is coming up with some way to measure what a “contender” actually is. In College Basketball, the NCAA tournament is what decides the champion each year. The “success” of teams year by year is often measured by how far a team made it in this tournament.\nTo capture these shades of success, I built a 0-100 Contender Score that assigns points based on the round reached in the NCAA tournament.\n\n\n\nRound Reached\nContender Score\n\n\n\n\nNational Champion\n100\n\n\nRunner-Up\n90\n\n\nFinal Four (lost in semi)\n80\n\n\nElite Eight\n68\n\n\nSweet 16\n56\n\n\nRound of 32\n44\n\n\nRound of 64\n32\n\n\nFirst Four loss\n20\n\n\nMissed Tournament\n5\n\n\n\nWhy this works:\n\nContinuity: instead of yes/no, we get a scale that lets us compare teams across tiers. Baylor 2021 (100) and Purdue 2023 (20) sit on opposite ends, while Elite Eight teams land in the middle.\nInterpretability: it’s intuitive for fans. Everyone understands that a Final Four run is “worth more” than just making the Sweet 16.\nModel Flexibility: it turns the prediction task into a regression problem, letting us rank all teams, even those that missed the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI gave National Champion (100) extra distance from Runner-Up (90) instead of including them both as the true full contenders. The reasoning is that winning it all is rare and deserves to stand out — it isn’t just one more step in the bracket, it’s the hardest step.\n\n\nIn short, the Contender Score let me bridge tournament outcomes with regular-season stats in a way that was numeric, intuitive, and model-friendly."

Instead, I ran a model bake-off: a wide set of regression algorithms ranging from simple linear models to tree ensembles and gradient boosting. Each model was wrapped in the same preprocessing pipeline (imputation + scaling), so the comparison was fair.\nThe models I use include:\n\nBaseline: a simple “predict the median” regressor as a sanity check.\nLinear models: plain Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet.\nDistance- and kernel-based models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR).\nTree ensembles: Random Forest, ExtraTrees, and Gradient Boosting.\nModern gradient methods: HistGradientBoosting and XGBoost.\n\nFor each model, I evaluated two metrics:\n\nR² (Coefficient of Determination) — Measures how much of the variation in the target (Contender Score) the model explains. Higher is better, with 1.0 = perfect prediction and 0 = no better than guessing the mean.\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error) — The average size of the prediction errors, in the same units as the target.

    "text": "Feature Importances\nNext, I wanted to see which statistics the model relied on the most when predicting a team’s Contender Score. By extracting the feature importances from the best-performing model, we can identify the stats that consistently separate true contenders from everyone else.\n&lt;style&gt;\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimportances = pd.Series(model.feature_importances_, index=X.columns).sort_values(ascending=False)\nimportances.head(10).plot(kind=\"barh\")\nplt.title(\"Top 10 Features by Importance\")\nplt.show()\n&lt;/style&gt;\n\n\n\nFeature\nImportance\n\n\n\n\nnet_rating_adjusted\n0.509060\n\n\nsimple_rating_system\n0.111872\n\n\nroad_win_percentage\n0.065917\n\n\nhome_win_percentage\n0.045770\n\n\nmargin_of_victory\n0.011484\n\n\nopponent_free_throw_percentage\n0.010957\n\n\nthree_point_percentage\n0.010426\n\n\nopponent_three_point_percentage\n0.009833\n\n\nstrength_of_schedule\n0.009164\n\n\nopponent_steal_percentage\n0.009055\n\n\nassist_percentage\n0.008437\n\n\nopponent_assist_percentage\n0.008384\n\n\nopponent_block_percentage\n0.008328\n\n\ndefensive_rating_adjusted\n0.008100\n\n\ndefensive_srs\n0.007704\n\n\n\nWhat stands out:\n\nAdjusted Net Rating (0.51) dominates — this combined offensive/defensive margin is by far the strongest single predictor of contender status.\nSimple Rating System (0.11) comes in second, reinforcing the value of all-around team strength.\nRoad (0.066) and Home (0.046) Win Percentages still appear prominently. These can be a little leaky if tournament games are included, but they capture consistency across environments.\nMargin of Victory and Defensive metrics — margin of victory (0.011), adjusted defensive rating (0.008), and defensive SRS (0.008) all show up, highlighting that elite defenses continue to matter.\nShooting efficiency matters — both a team’s own 3PT% (0.010) and their opponent’s 3PT% (0.010) play important roles, reminding us how much the perimeter game can swing outcomes.\nSupporting cast features — opponent FT% (0.011), opponent steals, blocks, and assists (all around 0.008–0.009), along with assist percentage (0.008), provide smaller but meaningful contributions. These capture discipline, ball movement, and defensive disruption.\nStrength of Schedule (0.009) remains in the mix, showing that teams tested against tougher competition are more likely to survive March."

    "text": "Wrapping Up\nThe GradientBoosting model (and other ensemble methods) can predict Contender Scores within about 3–5 points on average. That’s impressively accurate given the chaos of March Madness. Of course, there will always be outliers — 2014 UConn making a surprise run from a 7-seed or 2023 FAU storming to the Final Four — but even those Cinderella stories stand out precisely because they’re rare exceptions to the rule.\nWhen you zoom out across thousands of team-seasons, the data paints a clear, consistent profile of what true contenders look like:\n\nEfficiency rules — Adjusted Net Rating absolutely dominates the model. Teams that outscore their opponents by wide margins on a per-possession basis are almost always in the title conversation.\nConsistency counts — Home and road win percentages rise to the top of the importance list. Contenders don’t just rack up wins at home; they prove they can survive in hostile environments.\nDefense still wins — Opponent shooting metrics (eFG%, 3P%, FT%) and defensive efficiency underline that limiting opponents is a defining trait of champions. You can’t just outscore everyone — stops matter.\nStrength of Schedule matters — Contenders are forged against tough competition. Teams that cruise through weak schedules may look good on paper, but the model recognizes that they’re less prepared for the gauntlet of March.\nSupporting stats add nuance — Features like assist %, turnover/steal rates, and margin of victory don’t carry the same weight as net rating, but they sharpen the edges of the contender profile by capturing discipline, ball movement, and the ability to execute under pressure.\n\nPut simply: the numbers confirm what coaches and fans have long believed. True contenders are efficient, balanced, resilient, and battle-tested. While upsets will always capture headlines, the data shows that championships are built on fundamentals that consistently show up in the stats.\nDo you think that your team has what it takes? Make sure to keep an eye out for these key indicators the next time you are watching your favorite team to tell if they might be able to truly contend for a National Championship!"
